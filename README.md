This programme is for calculating the intensity of spesified area on any image.
For simplicity I named my images with number.
In the file of "Process...size" to see if we have cropped the right area as we expected.
In the file "retreive..." we can calculate the intensity on the specific area, and reading every single image is only allowed.
In the file "bath..." we can process multiple images in one time. For example, in my case, 100 images can be calculated in 2mins.
